# TransferLearningImagenet.pytorch

The aim of this repository is to give a base code for train pretrained ImageNet models on any database with very simple modifications. Code is done in pytorch and it uses the Pretrained models given by Pytorch developers. However, it is easy to incoporate any pretrained model on Pytorch as long as the necessary modifications are done. As example you can check this github with several pretrained models on ImageNet https://github.com/Cadene/pretrained-models.pytorch that you can use. This version uses pytorch version 0.4.0 with python 2.7 as the interpreter. You must use linux otherwise make the necessary modifications on the code. The code provide functionality for train a model, for test a model and for save the logits, ie, the pre softmax activation. Refer to user_guide.md for further description.
